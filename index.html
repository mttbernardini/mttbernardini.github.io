		<p>Hi, I'm a guy from Santa Marinella, Italy. I graduated in 2015 at the «Galileo Galilei» Scientific High School from Santa Marinella. I then received in 2019 the bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Roma Tre University. I'm looking forward to attend a master degree in Computer Science.</p>
		<p>I like maths, but from middle school I got into computer science and I fell in love with logical reasoning. I also have some extra hobbies, mainly as self-taught.</p>

		<h1 class="sec-title">Programming</h1>

		<p>I started my path in middle school in web development, learning <em>HTML</em> in 2006, thanks to Windows Live Spaces, and <em>PHP</em> in 2009 to make my first contact form for my first <a href="https://salvare-il-pianeta.blogspot.com">blog</a> (now discontinued). I then delved into <em>JavaScript</em> and <em>CSS</em> in 2011 and made my first web-app during high school, a <a href="https://github.com/mttbernardini/simple-chat">simple chat-room</a>.</p>
		<p>Attending the university course in Computer Science and Engineering, and thanks to more practice, I'm now also proficient in <em>C</em>, <em>Java</em>, <em>Python</em> and <em>C#</em>. I also studied <em>network</em> protocols, <em>database</em> design and <em>software design</em> (with an introduction to the Agile method).<p>
		<p>I'm a proud <em>Debian GNU/Linux</em> user since 2013. In 2017 I was selected for the <a href="https://cyberchallenge.it/halloffame/2017">CyberChallenge.IT</a> competition. In 2019 I participated in my <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2334/DLTpaper4.pdf">first publication</a> regarding the <em>blockchain</em> technology, which was the theme of my BSc thesis.</p>

		<h1 class="sec-title">Music</h1>

		<p>I started with the <em>piano</em> in 2009, then I got into <em>drums</em> in 2013. I can also play a bit the <em>electric guitar</em> and the <em>bass guitar</em>, mainly for <em>composing</em>.</p>
		<p>I don't think to fit on a specific genre because I like composing with different sounds and styles: piano solo is the most obvious one, but I also compose from rock stuff to EDM and Hip-Hop stuff, while experimenting with minimal stuff.</p>
		<p>Since 2013 I've been getting used to <em>produce</em> with a DAW. Since 2017 I'm working with <a href="http://bennydguardo.it/">Benny Di Guardo</a> as co-producer and manager. I'm also helping my cousin <a href="http://dankint.bandcamp.com/">Dankint</a> in the production and creative process.</p>
		<p>Two artist that I really enjoy (also as persons) are Fabrizio Paterlini and Jack Conte. Other artists from my music library include: Infected Mushroom, The Glitch Mob, Digitalism, Miracles Of Modern Science, Ludovico Einaudi, Yann Tiersen, Silent Strike, Pomplamoose, Evanescence.</p>
		<p>I'm distributing my music mainly through <a href="https://mttbernardini.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a>, but some albums may be found on the main digital stores too (iTunes, Google Play, Amazon, Spotify, etc...).</p>

		<h1 class="sec-title">Video making & photography</h1>

		<p>The last thing I really like doing is videos. I started in middle school, getting the <em>first prize</em> at the contest "Ciak si guida" 2010 of Quattroruote, with the short movie "Quando il giallo" (When the yellow...), made in a school lab. Then, in high school, I met Gisella Ianiri and I <em>assisted</em> in the making of <em>two professional documentaries</em>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/70772938">"Tre Sguardi"</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/114587150">"Lavori in corso"</a> (this one has English subtitles). I also helped making the <em>official video</em> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUxOVJHDgA">"I Just Can't Stop Loving You"</a> by Greta's Bakery.</p>
		<p>The quality jump was possible also because I learned how to <em>use a DSLR</em>. I also had a chance to direct my own <em>animation short movie</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzqhckXevK0">"Big Yellow Taxi"</a>, with the help of three friends, for a school project by <em>UNESCO</em>.</p>
		<p>In my spare time I like producing <em>musical videos</em> for my friends, under the name of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJW_4sXRt8zcGNZX7oyXOI2-78hkTfcIn">rh productions</a>.</p>
