		<p>Hi, I'm a student from Santa Marinella, Italy. I graduated in 2015 at the «Galileo Galilei» Scientific High School from Santa Marinella. Now I'm studing computer science at Roma Tre University.</p>
		<p>I like maths, but from middle school I got into computer science and I fell in love with logical reasoning and graphics. I also do some extra activities mainly as self-taught (I've been guided in few cases).</p>

		<h1 class="sec-title">Programming</h1>

		<p>Do you remember when Windows Live Spaces was a thing (tip: 2006/07)? I enojoyed having my blog, but I kinda got envy of the nice widgets my friends had on their blogs (audio players & stuff), so I learned how to put that stuff on my blog too. The thing that really catched my curiosity was that "copy and paste this HTML code" line that did the magic. «What the heck is "HTML"?». I really dislike not to give an answer to my questions, so that's how I learned what "HTML" meant and... well, I actually wanted to learn it.</p>
		<p>Knowing something "as powerful as" <em>html</em>, I decided to <a href="https://salvare-il-pianeta.blogspot.com">open a blog</a> on Blogger and take advantage of it to make customizations and... a "professional" contact form page, until I realized that html alone could not make the whole thing. That's how I got into my first programming language ever: <em>PHP</em>.</p>
		<p>Can I say it was love at first sight? of course not, but I actually fell in love with the programming logic behind it, so then I started to learn what is now my favorite language, <em>JavaScript</em>, and later I got into <em>Python</em>. It might seems as I know a lot about programming, but I actually <em>never made something ambitious</em> or big (consider that I never interacted with a database nor used mvc systems).</p>
		<p>In parallel I also learned really well <em>CSS</em>, how to make <em>basic graphic</em> things with GIMP and in 2016 I started to learn how to use Inkscape to take advantage of the "power of vectors". I'm not into professional webdesign yet, but I really like this sector.</p>
		<p>In 2016 I also signed to the Roma Tre University in <em>computer science</em>, so I'm definitely going to take this thing more seriously and hopefully make a job out of it. <em>Java</em> and <em>C</em> will be the languages I'll be dealing with there, other than learning a lot of other useful and really intensive stuff.</p>
		<p>My everyday ambient is <em>Linux Debian</em>, but I also use Windown (as I like to call it) for very few things (just 2 actually: videomaking and audio producing).</p>

		<h1 class="sec-title">Music</h1>

		<p>I started with the <em>piano</em> in 2009, then I got into <em>drums</em> in 2013. I can also play a bit the <em>electric guitar</em>, mainly for <em>composing</em>.</p>
		<p>From when I started with the piano I begun to discover my composition style, which at the beginning was quite obvious, but then I developed some originality. I don't think to fit on a specific genre because I like composing with different sounds and styles: piano solo is the most obvious one, but I also really like heavy stuff from metal to electronic, and I wish to make something that heavy and complex too some day.</p>
		<p>Especially from 2013 I've been getting used to <em>produce</em> with a DAW and be part of a <a href="https://facebook.com/random5music">rock band</a> too, so I'm more into complex compositions that don't involve the piano only part anymore. From 2015 I'm also trying to <em>write my own lyrics</em>, mainly for the band, because singing is not one of my instrumental choices.</p>
		<p>2 artist that I really enjoy (also as persons) are Fabrizio Paterlini and Jack Conte. Other artists from my music library include: Infected Mushroom, The Glitch Mob, Digitalism, Miracles Of Modern Science, Ludovico Einaudi, Yann Tiersen, Silent Strike, Pomplamoose, Evanescence.</p>
		<p>I'm distributing my music through <a href="https://mttbernardini.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a>, but I'm planning to release some albums on the other stores too (iTunes, Google Play, Amazon, Spotify, etc...).</p>

		<h1 class="sec-title">Video making & photography</h1>

		<p>The last thing I really like doing is videos. I started in middle school, getting the <em>first prize</em> at the contest "Ciak si guida" 2010 of Quattroruote, with the short movie "Quando il giallo" (When the yellow...), made in a school lab. Then, in high school, I met Gisella Ianiri and I <em>assisted</em> in the making of <em>two professional documentaries</em>, <a href="https://vimeo.com/70772938">"Tre Sguardi"</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/114587150">"Lavori in corso"</a> (this one has english subtitles). I also helped making the <em>videoclip</em> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqUxOVJHDgA">"I Just Can't Stop Loving You"</a> by Greta's Bakery.</p>
		<p>The quality jump was possible also because I learned how to <em>use a DSLR</em>. I also had a chance to direct my own <em>animation short movie</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzqhckXevK0">"Big Yellow Taxi"</a>, with the help of three friends, for a school project by <em>UNESCO</em>.</p>
		<p>I'd really like to make more movies, especially for my songs and for my band, but for now I can't because I don't have a performant enough pc. That's the real bottleneck.</p>
