I started developing software when I was 13 years old, as self-taught. My journey is characterised by two elements: curiosity and precision. I like taking new challenges and finding solutions to new problems, in a way that preserves structure, documentation and clean code. I prefer good architecture instead of finding a solution that just "works".

Still at 13 years old, also as self-taught, I started playing piano and writing music. I later played in bands as a drummer, arranged and written pieces. My focus is now on writing and producing music and doing sound design for shorts.

I combine my two passions by developing software for music purposes and researching technological solutions that can help musicians and composers.
